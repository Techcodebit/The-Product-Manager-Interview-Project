How do you handle major paradigm shifts?
========================================

> Tell me about a situation in which you had to adjust quickly to a
significant change in the products you manage and/or the teams whom you
serve because of a seismic shift in organization, department, or team
priorities. How did the change affect you? What did you do?

Reason
------

### Hypothesis

>  Economic, political, organizational, and social events can create huge waves in an organization. A great candidate knows how to maintain effectiveness when experiencing such major changes in work tasks or the work environment; adjusting effectively to work within new work structures, processes, requirements, or cultures.

### Measure of Success/Failure

1.  They donâ€™t just describe the change, but they offer details on some of the underlying issues. For example, layoffs due to not meeting sales targets would have different causal effects than an organization that was purchased by a private equity firm.
2.  Treats change and new situations as opportunities for learning or growth, focuses on the beneficial aspects of change; speaks positively about the change to others (this in contrast to expressing bitterness or blame).
3.  Succinctly describes decisive actions taken to maintain product viability and team productiveness in such trying times.
4.  Can identify effective changes they employed in terms of workflow, procedure, requirement, team structure, and/or corporate culture.
