# Number of Pianos at the ECU School of Music
> How many pianos are physically located at the East Carolina School of Music? Walk us through the steps.

## Reason
### Hypothesis
> In answering the question above, we believe that a qualified candidate will reveal a natural curiosity while demonstrating their analytical capabilities. 

### Measure of Success/Failure 
1. We will know the candidate has failed if they simply blurt out a wild guess without any discussion.
2. We will now the candidate may be qualified if they demonstrate the ability to ask questions to get themselves close to a realitic number. **The actual count doesn't matter**.
   * Is there a piano in each classroom and/or practice room? If so, how many classrooms and/or practice rooms are there? (35 + 50)
   * Are other rooms and facilities we have to consider?
   * How many students are there? What is the student-to-piano ratio (1.5:1)
   * Are we also counting electic keyboards?
3. An additional and optional measure of success is if the candidate asks why this count is relevant (or what has this have to do with product management?). If they do ask, you might want to respond with something along the lines of:
   > "Let's say we're developing a maintenance app that includes having to schedule the time of a single piano tuner across an entire school of music facility."

**Additional Success/Failure Notes** 
* It's often better to pose this question to individuals possess little or no experience with institutes such as the ECU School of Music. In fact, the same question could be easily converted to "How many computers are there at the Engineering Building at the NCSU Department of Computer Science?" or "How many laptops are in this office?"
* The larger point is, the less the candidate is familiar with such a facility, the greater the opportunity to reveal how they explore areas of unknown issues and quanities. 
* It is normal for a candidate to buy time so they can think. Unless they're a genius, a dive straight into an answer should raise a flag.
* It is normal for a qualified candidate to ask several questions, even some that may seem unrelated. Take time to explore their questions as their reasoning behind them can be quite revealing.
* It may help to relax more nervous candidates down by explaining to them that the exact number is not what we're after. Once calmed down, you may find such candidates actually provide some of the best conversations and approaches to the problem.
* You may get candidates who simply toss out a number because they don't undestand why you're asking. Similarly you may encounter candidates who say "I just go to Google and look it up." You may find such individuals lack the natural curiosity or analytical skills to move forward with your hiring process.
* Candidates are nervous enough, no need to toss questions at them that include having to have memorized some scientific equation.
