How do you build trust with your teams?
=======================================

> Can you compare this with an experience of when you’ve taken over
as a product owner for a well-established team?

> **Follow-up #1** Can you describe a time when you have taken
over as a product owner for a newly created team?

> **Follow-up #2** Were any of the team members particularly
difficult in winning over? If so, how did you manage that relationship?

Reason

### Hypothesis

> We not only believe that any product managers and product owners
> who are claiming they have at least 3 to 5 years’ experience will have
> not only experienced working with a new team, but will understand the
> hurdles of building trust in both a situation where they are a new
> hire, versus one where they are moved to another team.

### Measure of Success/Failure

1.  The successful candidate doesn’t just describe the obvious
    differences at a superficial level, but they offer some deeper
    insights from the vantage point of what they had to do from a
    servant-leader point of view, and why.

2.  Follow-up \#2 is particularly telling as an optimal candidate will
    convey the situation without making things personal, and instead
    offer observations or narrations on how they treated more resistant
    team members with them with dignity, respect, and fairness.

3.  Does the candidate describe actions that demonstrate their ability
    to listen to others and objectively, considering the opinions of
    others, and/or incorporating the ideas of their new teammates?

4.  A candidate with exceptional experiences in an Agile context might
    describe how they leveraged rituals such as retrospectives, or other
    face-to-face/person-to-person exercises and opportunities to earn
    trust.
