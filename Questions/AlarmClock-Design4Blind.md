# Design an alarm clock for the blind
> How would you design an alarm clock for the blind? 

## Reason
### Hypothesis
> In answering the question above, we believe that a qualified candidate will demonstrate the ability to ask pertinent questions from the point of view of the customer. 

### Measure of Success/Failure 
1. We will know the candidate has failed if they too quickly jump into an answer based on too few questions.
2. We will now the candidate may be qualified if they demonstrate the ability to ask relevant questions to get themselves close to a reasonable design, for example:
   * How many of the users are partially blind versus completely blind?
   * Do we have to take into consideration any other physical limitations?
   * Is the customer accustomed to using an alarm regular alarm clock? If they're familiar with a regular alarm clock, is there an existing design we can expand upon?
   * Where would the alarm clock be located?
   * How is the alamr clock powered?
3. Additionally, a very qualified candidate might go into detail in some unique design aspects that indicate the ability to quickly understand the user's need such as:
   * A device that can be controlled via voice commands
   * Backup Braille on very large buttons
   * Weighted base so the clock isn't accidentally knocked over
   * A LED display for partners who may not be visually impaired.
