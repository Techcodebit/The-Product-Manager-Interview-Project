# The-Product-Manager-Interview-Project

Inspired out of a conversation on hiring product managers in the [Triangle Area Product Slack room](triproduct.slack.com), we're hoping this project provides the product management community a useful enumeration of community qualified interview questions and exercises.

## How it works

The idea here is to treat questions and exercises like code. Here's how ... at least for now:

1. Create directories for questions and exercises
2. Focus first on questions for the first few iterations
3. Submit all questions as .md files, using the [Github markdown format](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
4. Treat question submissions like code by:
  * Leveraging the Github [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/) for reviewing submissions
  * Encouraging community conversations to determine whether or not a question should be accepted, rejected, or modified
5. Once we know what we're doing with interview questions, explore and expand an exercises directory

## Rules of the Road

* Let's not spam each other, instead impress us with question contributions and code-review participation.
* Avoid using copyrighted material, but alway feel free to over-attribute or over-artifact submissions with copious linkage .
* Let's strive for questions of high value to the interviewer, candidate, or both. 
* Avoid questions that have little or nothing to do with product managment (i.e., what's your greatest weakness?).
* Use this as an opportunity to learn Github. Meaning, kvetching about the tools we're using will likely be ignored.
* Make mistakes, and don't jump ugly with others when they do. We're still nudging this process towards perfection.
* Share what you've learned, either through awesome errors or cool tools you've discovered along the way.
* Have fun! The interview process is hard enough for all of us on all sides of the operation.
