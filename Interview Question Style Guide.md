# Question Title (# H1)
> (> Blockquote) The question title will be followed by a [blockquote](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#blockquotes) to render the actual question asked of the candidate. The '>' blockquote markdown must immediately follow the question title/h1 '#' markdown.

This can be followed by or include whatever [github markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is needed to refer to [links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links), [images](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images), [code](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code), and other artifacts needed to express the question.

**Note**, a sure way to get a question rejected is to include self-promotion spammage.

## Reason (## H2)

### Hypothesis (### H3)

It'll employ the '##' H2 to mark the section, with '###' H3 marking the two subsections. The hypothesis itself will employ the '>" blockquote markdown.

### Measure of Success/Failure (### H3)
1. (1. ...) Employs the [List](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists) markdown 
2. Provides, as much as possible, tangible measures for success or failure.
